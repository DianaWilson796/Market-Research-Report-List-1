<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-Static Floor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Laying Anti-Static Floor</li><li>Anti-Static Access Floor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The anti-static floor market comprises two primary types: direct laying anti-static floors and anti-static access floors. Direct laying anti-static floors are installed directly onto solid substrates, providing a seamless surface that helps prevent static electricity buildup in sensitive environments. In contrast, anti-static access floors consist of raised floor tiles that allow for easy access to electrical and mechanical systems beneath, while simultaneously offering static dissipation features. Both types are essential for maintaining a static-free environment in industries like electronics and data centers.</p></p>
