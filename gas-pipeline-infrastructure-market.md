<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gas Pipeline Infrastructure Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transmission</li><li>Distribution</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The gas pipeline infrastructure market is categorized into two primary segments: transmission and distribution. Transmission pipelines are high-pressure systems responsible for transporting natural gas over long distances, typically from production areas to regional hubs. Distribution pipelines, on the other hand, operate at lower pressures and are used to deliver gas from these hubs directly to consumers, including homes and businesses. Both segments are crucial for ensuring the efficient and safe delivery of natural gas across various regions.</p></p>
