<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Glass Fibre Noise Barrier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ground-Mounted Noise Barrier</li><li>Structure-Mounted Noise Barrier</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Glass Fibre Noise Barrier market consists of two primary types: ground-mounted and structure-mounted noise barriers. Ground-mounted noise barriers are installed directly on the ground, typically along highways or railways, providing a protective acoustic shield against traffic noise. In contrast, structure-mounted noise barriers are integrated into existing structures such as buildings, bridges, or walls, enhancing sound insulation in urban areas. Both types effectively reduce sound transmission, improving environmental quality and enhancing the comfort of surrounding communities.</p></p>
