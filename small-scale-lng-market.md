<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Small Scale LNG Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquefaction Terminal</li><li>Regasification Terminal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The small-scale LNG market is divided into two main types: liquefaction terminals and regasification terminals. Liquefaction terminals convert natural gas into liquid form, facilitating storage and transport to remote locations. These terminals often serve smaller consumers or regions lacking pipeline infrastructure. In contrast, regasification terminals convert the liquid back into gas for distribution to end users, such as industries or power plants. Both types play a crucial role in enhancing energy accessibility and flexibility in global markets.</p></p>
