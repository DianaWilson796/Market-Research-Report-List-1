<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wet Chemical Fire Suppression Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Release System</li><li>Indirect Release System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wet chemical fire suppression systems are essential for managing chemical fires, particularly in commercial kitchens. The market is divided into two main types: direct release systems and indirect release systems. </p><p>Direct release systems discharge the suppressing agent directly onto the fire source, ensuring rapid extinguishment. In contrast, indirect release systems use a network of pipes and nozzles to distribute the suppressing agent in an enclosed area, effectively targeting potential fire hazards without immediate contact with the flames. Both types are crucial for fire safety compliance.</p></p>
